# `.brd` Parser Tool

This repository provides a library to parse `.brd` files generated by Cadence's [Allegro suite][cadence-allegro][^1] of PCB design tools.

It also contains:

1. A [web application][webapp] for viewing `.brd` files
2. A mediocre Qt GUI for viewing `.brd` files
3. A mediocre command line tool that opens `.brd` files and outputs some random info to verify it was able to read it.

## Usage

The main goal of this library is to write an example decoder that can eventually be integrated into other tools.

### Prerequisites

Dependencies are managed through [vcpkg][vcpkg] (see `src/vcpkg.json`). The only required dependency for the library is [Boost][boost], at least version 1.71. It is installed via `vcpkg`.

[Qt6][qt6] is an optional dependency, used in the GUI viewer only. Qt6 is only required when running `cmake` with `-DBUILD_GUI=ON`.

* On Mac, Qt6 can be installed using Brew: `brew install qt6`
* On Ubuntu, Qt6 can be installed using Apt: `sudo apt install qt6-base-dev libgl1-mesa-dev`

### Build

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:jeffwheeler/brd_parser.git
$ cd brd_parser
$ cmake -B build -S src -DBUILD_GUI=ON -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${VCPKG}/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
$ cmake --build build
```

### Run tools

The GUI will open a graphical view of a PCB:
```shell
$ ./build/brd_gui/brd_gui [.brd filename]
```

For example, opening the [BeagleBone AI design][bb-ai] (distributed under the terms of the [CC-BY-4.0 license][bb-ai-license]) and showing a few layers looks like this:

<img src="/docs/images/BeagleBone-AI.png" width="600" alt="BeagleBone AI .brd viewed in brd_gui" />

The command line tool will output an HTML file with some random information about the PCB, confirming the file was successfully parsed:
```shell
$ ./build/brd_cli/brd_cli (.brd filename) > out.html
```

### Run tests

```shell
$ ctest -j10 --output-on-failure
```

## Decoding Methodology

This library was written with **no access any to Cadence software.** It was written 100% by hand-decoding the binary file format found in freely-available design files (see [`test/data/`][test-data] for examples). I have never once even opened the free Allegro Viewer to assist in decoding these files.

This is the output of hundreds of hours of staring at the binary data in a hex editor and finding patterns.
