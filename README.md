# .brd Parser Tool

This repository provides a library to parse `.brd` files generated by Cadence's [Allegro suite][cadence-allegro][^1] of PCB design tools. It also contains a few tools to demonstrate using the core library, such as a GUI viewer.

## Usage

The main goal of this library is to write an example decoder that can eventually be integrated into other tools. However, to assist with the development, there is a (mediocre) GUI viewer that can show what was parsed in the files.

### Prerequisites

The only dependency is [Qt6][qt6], which is used in the GUI viewer only. Qt6 is only required when running `cmake` with `-DBUILD_GUI=ON`.

* On Mac, Qt6 can be installed using Brew: `brew install qt6`
* On Ubuntu, Qt6 can be installed using Apt: `sudo apt install qt6-base-dev libgl1-mesa-dev`

### Build

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:jeffwheeler/brd_parser.git
$ cd brd_parser
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../src/ -DBUILD_GUI=ON
$ make
```

### Run tools

The GUI will open a graphical view of a PCB:
```shell
$ ./brd_gui/brd_gui [.brd filename]
```

For example, opening the [BeagleBone AI design][bb-ai] (distributed under the terms of the [CC-BY-4.0 license][bb-ai-license]) and showing layer *LAY8* looks like this:

<img src="/docs/images/BeagleBone-AI.png" width="600" alt="BeagleBone AI .brd viewed in brd_gui" />

The command line tool will output an HTML file with some random information about the PCB, confirming the file was successfully parsed:
```shell
$ ./brd_cli/brd_cli (.brd filename) > out.html
```

### Run tests

```shell
ctest -j10 --output-on-failure
```

## Decoding Methodology

This library was written with **no access any to Cadence software.** It was written 100% by hand-decoding the binary file format found in freely-available design files (see [`test/data/`][test-data] for examples). I have never once even opened the free Allegro Viewer to assist in decoding these files.

This is the output of hundreds of hours of staring at the binary data in a hex editor and finding patterns.
